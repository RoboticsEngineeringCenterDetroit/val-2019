# Val

2019 FIRST Robotics Destination: Deep Space robot for Team 5577 (Kinematic Wolves of Detroit Cristo Rey High School, working within DHDC/RECD)

## Why The Name Val?

- [Valentina Tereshkova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_Tereshkova) was a Soviet cosmonaut and the first woman in space, on theme for this year's game, and a celebration of women in STEM.
- [Valentina hot sauce](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_(hot_sauce)>) is amazing. Only somewhat related.

## What's New This Year?

- üìê CTRE magnetic encoder‚Äìbased PID control for the intake arm mechanism and the elevator mechanism. We're able to measure angles and heights fairly precisely, and move these mechanisms to desired setpoints. A major shout out to Ted of [Team 4680](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/4680) (AzTech Eagles of C√©sar Ch√°vez Academy in Detroit, MI, also working within DHDC/RECD) for the idea behind this PID control scheme.
- üèë Shuffleboard display of angle, height, and encoder count information. This was super handy for debugging encoder measurements even while the robot was disabled.
- üéÆ Joystick and D-pad buttons! We've wanted these in our control scheme for years, and we finally got these buttons working as input! A big thanks to [Team 1675](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/1675) (UPS (Ultimate Protection Squad) of Milwaukee, WI) for the code example for `DPadButton`, and to [Team 2168](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2168) (Aluminum Falcons of Fitch High School in Groton, CT) for the code example for `JoystickAnalogButton`!
